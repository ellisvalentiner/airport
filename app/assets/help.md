Wireless signal strength is usually measured using the power ratio of [decibels (db)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decibel).

The maximum received signal power of a wireless network (802.ll) is about -10 dBm. The maximum achievable signal strength is typically about -30 dBm. Signal strength less than -80 dBm
